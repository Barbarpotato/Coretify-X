- The client sends an initial request to the proxy (Coretify). This request does not include any sensitive tokens, ensuring secure interaction from the client side.
- The proxy generates a signed JWT token and sends it back to the client. This token serves as a temporary authentication mechanism.
- The client sends a new request to the Site Registry (CDN) and includes the JWT token received from the proxy in the request header.
- The Site Registry verifies the JWT token by forwarding it to the proxy. The proxy acts as a validator to confirm the tokenâ€™s validity.
- If the proxy validates the JWT token, it grants access to the requested resource on the Site Registry. The requested data is then sent back to the client through the proxy.
